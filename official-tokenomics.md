   To further establish trust, we will implement a multisig wallet for controlling these funds. This means that multiple signatories will be required to authorize transactions, providing an additional layer of security and transparency.

Furthermore, we're committed to the principle of community governance. The initial token allocation isn't set in stone. As we establish governance protocols, token holders will be able to participate in key decisions about the project, potentially including re-evaluating token allocations. We're excited to empower our community in this way and look forward to seeing the project evolve based on your input.

This token allocation provides a balance between immediate liquidity, ongoing costs, and long-term sustainability. Our commitment is to ensure the successful growth of the GeekyPunks franchise, while delivering maximum value to our GP token holders.
